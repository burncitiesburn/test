<p>What you will find here is my own attempt to translate the Closed Captions and Audio Description for <em>Evangelion:3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time</em>, or <em>Shin Evangelion Gekijouban</em>. (Closed Captions are the dialogue, select sound effects and music cues, and so forth. Audio Description is a spoken narration of what's happening on-screen. They're intended for the hearing- and visually impaired, respectively.)  Originally I started off just doing the CCs, but eventually I got restless and started digging into the AD as well. The four sub-pages are intended to mimic the four-part division of the film, but I'm just guessing how it's divided, and am therefore not using any official terminology (A-Part, B-Part, etc.) for my tentative quartering. </p>
<p>Three of the sections are still incomplete, alas. This project gives me good motivation to get some much-needed practice in, so I'll continue to work toward its completion until it's either done or the movie reaches us <em>gaijin</em>. Please note that I am not fluent, so, while I do the best I can to be accurate, silly mistakes will happen. Full disclaimer that I do make use of machine tools, but <em>as</em> tools; I don't rely 100% on them. There are those who snub their nose at any novice efforts and think that nothing is better than something, while forgetting that "nothing" doesn't exist in this day and age. People will simply put blind trust in machines to quickly get what they want. For that reason, I make no apologies for the existence of these pages. The human oversight makes a very obvious difference in quality and reliability, <em>and</em> I'm getting better in the process.</p>
<p>The original CC and AD files were obtained (very cleverly and illicitly) by individuals who wish to not be named. Many thanks to their hard work getting us this information early. I've attempted to sync the CCs and AD with one another, and the timing -- provided here in 30-second increments -- should be generally accurate in a relative kind of way. The time stamps won't line up with the film itself, but they still show how things are spaced out, hence "relative". </p>
<p>An initial AD transcription was obtained using YouTube (heh) and I've been cleaning it up as I go along. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWGoquYI3X0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>You may find the AD with WIP transcription here</u></a>. I'll try to provide my cleaned-up transcription of the closed captions at some point. (Needs a bit of formatting done to it.) </p>
<p>Due to my <strong>DANGEROUS</strong> LEVELS OF NON-PROFESSIONAL INEPTITUDE (lol), I'll try to note where I'm especially unsure about something and provide the raw Japanese as reference. Don't hesitate to inform me if you see an error.</p>

<p><em>Closed Captions (Sound Effects)</em></p><hr/><p><strong>↓ </strong>(down arrow) = in-page link to extended notes</p><hr/><p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> Avant 1 may feel so old by now that a reassessment of its dialogue is probably not at the top of everyone's minds. However, as far as I'm aware, fans have never produced a translation for it completely from scratch based on the original Japanese. (It's... complicated.) So, here, I've revisited that old group effort from summer 2019 at EGF (which, at the time, I cleaned up to the best of my ability and added to the EvaGeeks Wiki). There are some old mistakes in there I'm not too proud of, so I've fixed those, along with making countless other adjustments. Hopefully the following section will provide some fresh insight into this sequence for English-speaking fans.]</p>
<p>[00:02:09, 102]</p>
<p>(Mari singing over comms)</p>
<p>(♪) <em>﻿This life we lead is a long way up,</em></p>
<p><em>       but it's not about the length. If you...</em></p>
<p>(Toei)</p>
<p>(♪) ﻿...<em>lived the straight road of truth, then..</em></p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Here, Mari is singing "<em>Shinjitsu Ichiro no March</em>", or "The Straight Road of Truth March", by Kiyoko Suizenji. (Same artist responsible for "The 365-Step March" that Mari sings at the beginning of <em>Ha</em>.) A little more information plus a full translation of the song <a href="http://kayokyokuplus.blogspot.com/2017/02/kiyoko-suizenji-shinjitsu-ichiro-no.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>here</u></a>.] </p>
<p>(khara, Inc.)</p>
<p>(A completely red Eiffel Tower seen from directly below.)</p>
<p>[00:02:30, 105]</p>
<p><strong>Aoba (comms):</strong></p>
<p>Paris Assault fleet is shipshape.</p>
<p>Currently descending to Point Zero of the inner city.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Paris IRL does have a geographical marking called "Point Zero", but it's outside Notre Dame Cathedral, not next to the Arc of Triumph.]</p>
<p><strong>Nagara (comms): </strong></p>
<p>All ships, assume a defensive position.</p>
<p>Slowly go astern.</p>
<p>Gravity control, autonomous behavior, and remote operations: all clear.</p>
<p><strong>Hyuga (comms):</strong></p>
<p>The skies over Paris are clear all around.</p>
<p>Status of the surface: category 6 core-conversion.</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>Verifying our ship's spatial coordinates.</p>
<p>It's reached the operation's starting point.</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Roger.</p>
<p>Deploy the fleet in alert mode.</p>
<p>(A vertically long cluster drops down at a perpendicular. </p>
<p>It opens like an umbrella unfolding upside-down.</p>
<p>At that point, eight large-scale warships disperse, moving horizontally.) </p>
<p>[00:03:01, 112]</p>
<p><strong>Nagara (comms):</strong></p>
<p>Switching fleet's formation to alert mode.</p>
<p>Eva-08 and DSRV now descending to objective point.</p>
<p>(The fleet, lined up end to end, revolves above the cityscape.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari (comms):</strong></p>
<p>(♪) <em>Tambourine!</em></p>
<p><em>Tambourine, tambourine!</em></p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: This is still "The Straight Road of Truth March".] </p>
<p>(Eva-08, suspended at the center of a [mechanical] ring, </p>
<p>unloads a submersible vessel-like transport onto the apex of a giant black pillar.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari (comms):</strong></p>
<p>(♪) <em>Tambouriiiiiine!</em></p>
<p><strong>Crewman B:</strong></p>
<p>Landing pad anchors, normal.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: "Landing pad anchors" is literally "foot component adhesion system" (脚部吸着システム).]</p>
<p><strong>Crewman C:</strong></p>
<p>Hull has locked into position.</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>The DSRV has landed.</p>
<p>Analyzing the atmospheric composition...</p>
<p>CO² is tolerable.</p>
<p>We can stay here.</p>
<p>[00:03:31, 121]</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Roger. Let's start the mission.</p>
<p>(Ritsuko, wearing a green protective suit, alights [from the transport] and goes all the way to the pillar's edge.</p>
<p>Under the blue sky, the Eiffel Tower and the whole downtown area are discolored by core-conversion.)</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>It's been 16 years since I was here last.</p>
<p>Look at what's become of the famous City of Light...</p>
<p>It breaks my heart.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Ritsuko actually calls it "<em>Hana no Miyako</em>" (花の都), literally "The Flower Capital", but <em>hana</em> here is probably in its 華やか sense -- "showy", "gaudy", or -- to use some old-timey language -- "gay". I wonder if "<em>Hana no Miyako</em>" comes from the old nickname "Gay Paris" (pronounced "Gay Paree").]</p>
<p><em>{Warning Sound}</em></p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>The L-Barrier density is higher than we predicted.</p>
<p>The operation to restore Nerv EU Sealing Pillar No. 1 must be completed within 720 seconds, starting now.</p>
<p>[00:04:00, 128]</p>
<p>(The crew attach cables to the pillar and operate on their PCs.)</p>
<p><strong>Crewman A:</strong></p>
<p>The hell? </p>
<p>That's 180 seconds less than planned!</p>
<p><strong>Crewman B:</strong></p>
<p>Does that even give us time to return to base?</p>
<p>(Kitakami, also suited up.)</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>But seriously, only the Eva pilots should have to wear these awful things.</p>
<p>(Her figure is accentuated.) </p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Shut your yap and get to work!</p>
<p>(There's a hand-written message on the hatch of the pillar.)</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Well? Think we'll be able to activate the Anti-L System?</p>
<p><strong>Crewman A: </strong></p>
<p>Yes. We should be able to redo stages 4 and up.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> Yes, that's the English word "redo". Anno's not at his most subtle here...]</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to our predecessors.</p>
<p>([The message] reads, "Take care of the rest".)</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>We will uphold your wish to save the city.</p>
<p>(Ibuki presses her hands together.)</p>
<p>[00:04:30, 137]</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Let's get to work.</p>
<p>(They start the program.)</p>
<p><em>{Electronic sounds}</em></p>
<p>(Glowing specks appear in the distant sky.)</p>
<p><strong>Kitamari:</strong></p>
<p>Here they come!</p>
<p>Aerial specialization type, identified as Eva 44A.</p>
<p>Closing in at 4 o'clock!</p>
<p>(A huge number of enemies.)</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Such a splendid single line formation.</p>
<p>(A vast swath of them stretches out [into the distance].)</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Organizing into a colony all on their own...</p>
<p>They've already become a new organism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> "Colony" is 群体 (<em>guntai</em>), i.e. in a biological sense.]</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>I need you to intercept, Mari.</p>
<p>Buy us 560 more seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, ma'am!<u>↓</u> </p>
<p>I'll draw off all the 44A straightaway!</p>
<p>Alright, Nagara and the team, <u>↓</u> </p>
<p>my wire stunts are in your hands! </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: You might remember the subs having her refer to "cable flight" here. The term Mari uses is 操演 (<em>souen</em>), which refers to practical effects like pyrotechnics and wire stunts. So I decided to step out of the way and let Mari do her fourth wall breaking unimpeded.]</p>
<p>(Eva-08 gets pulled high into the sky.) </p>
<p>[00:05:00, 147]</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Well, well, well...! (♪)</p>
<p>(The bespectacled Mari in her pink plugsuit, making her Eva -- suspended inside its ring -- rotate in all directions.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Yaw, roll, pitch...</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: This is aircraft lingo, referring to three rotational axes, with relation to the nose of the plane. Yaw is left-right (horizontal) rotation, roll is exactly what it sounds like, and pitch is up-down (vertical) rotation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>More here</u></a>.]</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>It's interesting, but... this setup just feels plain off.</p>
<p>Wish they'd at <em>least</em> stuck with a humanoid motion range!</p>
<p>(Mari twists her body.</p>
<p>The autocannons on both arms emit muzzle flashes.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>*battle cry*</em></p>
<p><em>{Rapid-firing}</em></p>
<p>(The enemy units detonate one after another.)</p>
<p><em>{Explosions}</em></p>
<p>[00:05:25, 153]</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>Eva-08 currently engaged in hostilities with first wave of 44As.</p>
<p>Second wave has been detected.</p>
<p>As planned, all 44As are focused on Eva-08.</p>
<p>420 seconds remaining for the operation.</p>
<p>(The crew atop the pillar, still tapping away on their keyboards.)</p>
<p><strong>Crewman A:</strong></p>
<p>This is taking forever, Chief.</p>
<p>It's like working on an 8-bit computer.</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Same as the Evas, it's a non-human, unknown, and unexplained system.</p>
<p>It can't be controlled with our language easily.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Non-human as in a non-human sapience (人外,<em> jingai</em>). Meaning, the tech behind the Evas and the sealing pillars is "non-human" (non-Lilin) in origin. Not much of a revelation with Gendo's infodumps later, but this was a pretty big deal before the full movie came out.] </p>
<p><strong>Crewman B:</strong></p>
<p>Stage 4's been cleared. </p>
<p>We're way behind schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Stay calm but step it up.</p>
<p><strong>Crewmen:</strong></p>
<p>Yes, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Mari: </strong></p>
<p><em>*battle cry*</em></p>
<p>(Mari in the sky.) </p>
<p>[00:05:58, 165]</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Maintain speed. Plus 20 to guiding.</p>
<p>Keep the current tilt. <u>↓</u> </p>
<p>Forward ho! </p>
<p>(She swings backwards.)</p>
<p><em>{Rapid-firing}</em></p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Get back here!</p>
<p>(She turns the steering wheel. Eva-08 spins around repeatedly as it hangs in midair.)</p>
<p><em>{Rapid-firing}</em></p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Urrrgh!</em></p>
<p>(Both arms outstretched, Eva-08 rapid-fires left and right.) </p>
<p><em>{Rapid-firing}</em></p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Nya-nya-nyaa!</em> A<em>-HA!</em></p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: "<em>Nya-nya</em>" (にゃにゃ) is feline onomatopoeia, just as you'd think. Why is Mari using it as a refrain while she's killing things? I dunno, Mari is weird.]</p>
<p><em>{Rapid-firing}</em></p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Nya-nya-nya-nya-nyan! Nya-nya-nyaa!</em></p>
<p>(The autocannons immaculately trace over the chain of enemy units.)</p>
<p><em>{Rapid-firing}</em></p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Nya-nya-nya, nya-nya-nya-nya-nyaa!</em></p>
<p>(The bright red gun barrels melt down.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Whoops!</p>
<p>(Mari detaches the autocannons.</p>
<p>A building on the surface takes a direct hit.</p>
<p>A new enemy formation spirals around Mari.) </p>
<p>[00:06:34, 177]</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>The 4th wave, huh?</p>
<p>I'm outnumbered here.</p>
<p>As they say, "Many a small bird drive away a hawk."</p>
<p>(Top of the pillar.) </p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>360 seconds remaining.</p>
<p><strong>Crewman A:</strong></p>
<p>This is bad! </p>
<p>We haven't found the shortcut to stage 5.</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Don't give me that. Keep looking!</p>
<p><strong>Crewman B:</strong></p>
<p>We can't! </p>
<p>There's not enough time to overwrite the data!</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>"Can't", my rear end. </p>
<p>Run more bypasses!</p>
<p><strong>Crewman C:</strong></p>
<p>But Chief, we don't have that long until...</p>
<p>[00:06:59, 185]</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Stop whining!</p>
<p>This is why I can't stand young guys.</p>
<p>(The sky.) </p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>(Eva-08 charges into an enemy and punches it.</p>
<p>With one hand on the wheel, Mari steers backwards.) </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Several Mari vocalizations from the next 15 sec. of closed captions are omitted here.]</p>
<p>(While the weaponless Eva is swinging around, it indiscriminately delivers kicks to enemies.</p>
<p>Eva-08 moves around acrobatically.</p>
<p>Raising an arm, it smashes two enemy units.</p>
<p>Breezily it lands punches and chops on its foes.</p>
<p>It somersaults in front of the sun, then stomps on an enemy unit.) </p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Heave-ho!</em></p>
<p>(Together they fall to the surface, upon which Eva-08 is pulled up in a jiffy.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Hah!</em></p>
<p><em>(Explosion}</em></p>
<p>(The enemy unit releases a big explosion.) </p>
<p>[00:07:28, 197]</p>
<p>(Mari is pursued by a crowd of enemies.</p>
<p>She seizes one of them, and skewers her pursuer on one of its companion's spears.) </p>
<p>The enemy units successively thrust their spears into each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>*battle cry*</em></p>
<p>(A rounded cluster is formed that Mari swings around in a wide arc.</p>
<p>Once she picks up enough momentum, she flings it.) </p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Bugger off, you stupid bastards!</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: If I was fluent in Brit, I would write <em>all</em> of Mari's lines accordingly. But alas...]</p>
<p>(The cluster of enemies blows apart as it rolls on the ground.) </p>
<p><em>{Explosions}</em></p>
<p>(Bright light radiates from it, and it goes up in a giant ball of flame.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Heh heh!</em></p>
<p>That was too easy!</p>
<p><em>{Warning sound}</em></p>
<p>(There's a warning display on her monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>What's this...?</p>
<p>A pseudo-Angel using decoys?</p>
<p>You little devil!</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: You might remember my old mistranslation about "fake Angel lures". (I do apologize for that.) <a href="https://www.arqacrypha.net/post/eva-3-0-1-0-cc-ad-translation-pt-1#viewer-9tnot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>See here</u></a> for an explanation of this "pseudo-" business.] </p>
<p>[00:07:58, 206]</p>
<p>(A camouflage cocoon is smashed open.</p>
<p>When the white wall tumbles down, </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>the giant monster behind it is revealed.</p>
<p>It's accompanied by a horde of underlings.) </p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>It's out! Time for the boss fight! <u>↓</u> </p>
<p>(Ritsuko beholds this.) </p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>A military use of the Evas, forbidden by the Vatican Treaty.</p>
<p>A ground combat-type 4444C outfitted with a positron cannon, </p>
<p>accompanied by 44Bs specialized for supplying power.</p>
<p>Unleashing them together like this... </p>
<p>Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki must be testing us.</p>
<p>(The line-up of 44Bs stop walking.</p>
<p>Their generators vibrate, and bluish-white sparks begin to scatter.) </p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>The 44Bs' high-energy levels are rising!</p>
<p>[00:08:31, 212]</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko: </strong></p>
<p>All ships, shift to surface-to-surface defense. </p>
<p>All hands, invoke anti-shock and -EM measures. </p>
<p>(The revolving battleships all come together in unison.</p>
<p>They get in between the pillar and the hostiles, the bilges facing the enemy and the ships overlapping each other like the petals of a flower.) </p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>The 4444C has entered firing stance.</p>
<p>44Bs, currently generating huge amounts of electricity.</p>
<p>Energy is being fed to the ultra-high voltage discharge system.</p>
<p>The entire 4444C power-feeding system is open! </p>
<p>Positron acceleration system undergoing final phase.</p>
<p>Breechblock is closing! </p>
<p>[00:09:03, 219]</p>
<p>(The laser receiver behind the aimed gun barrel takes on a glow.) </p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>Incoming!</p>
<p>(The eyes of the 4444C Evas brighten, and the beams emitted by the surrounding 44Bs are collected by the sphere of the laser receiver.</p>
<p>The Evas' eyes flare up.</p>
<p>The barrel of the cannon releases a blinding light.) </p>
<p><em>{Cannon firing}</em></p>
<p>(The warships take a direct hit.</p>
<p>One by one, the ships split in half and get blown away.</p>
<p>A hull and a turret fall onto part of downtown.</p>
<p>A triangular bow crashes into the Eiffel Tower,</p>
<p>and the smashed upper half comes tumbling down.) </p>
<p>(Top of the pillar.)</p>
<p>[00:09:31, 221]</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami, et al.:</strong></p>
<p><em>Uggghhhhh... </em></p>
<p>(The scorching shockwave assails the crew.</p>
<p>The warship in the foreground is slowly being pushed toward the pillar.</p>
<p>Ritsuko, standing at full height, stares it down.</p>
<p>The ship's hull approaches right before her eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Hah!</em></p>
<p>(Eva-08 does a flying kick.) </p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Made it just in time!</p>
<p>If they fire again, we're toast!</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>44Bs' high-energy levels are rising again.</p>
<p>They're condensing electricity into their high-output power emitters!</p>
<p>(The 4444C demolishes the buildings around it to get a more stable foothold.) </p>
<p><em>{Smashing}</em></p>
<p>[00:09:58, 227]</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>Already?!</p>
<p>4444C has initiated particle acceleration. </p>
<p>It's ready to fire!</p>
<p>We're screwed!</p>
<p>Second shot incoming!</p>
<p><em>This is really, really bad!</em></p>
<p>(While bumping the pointed top section against the ground, </p>
<p>Eva-08 runs with the broken-off Eiffel Tower in its arms.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Urrrrrggggh!</em></p>
<p>Nagara, bridge crew -- a diversion please! </p>

</strong>ONWARD TO PART 1-B?　<a href="https://www.arqacrypha.net/post/eva-3-0-1-0-cc-ad-translation-pt-1" rel="noopener" target="_self"><u>⇒</u></a></p><hr/><h3>Extended Notes</h3>
<p>[00:04:52, 144] <strong>"Yes, ma'am!"</strong> Mari says 「合点でいっ！」 (<em>Gatten dei!</em>) here. I'm not completely sure what the "<em>dei</em>" part is -- modified form of だ (<em>da</em>)? -- but the "<em>gatten</em>" is interesting. This is the relatively idiosyncratic way that Sanson and Hanson answer Grandis' commands (so "Roger!", "Will do!", "Got it!", "Yes ma'am!", etc.) in <em>Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</em>. People often comment upon the recycled bit of Mari animation here, while not noticing the other thing that's "recycled". In <em>Q</em>, when the shot is first used, Mari says 「合点承知！」(<em>"Gatten shouchi!"</em>), which is a slightly longer way to say the same basic thing as just "<em>Gatten!</em>" (and Grandis' lackeys use the "<em>Gatten shouchi</em>" form sometimes, too). On top of all that, Mari actually channels Sanson specifically in a number of ways. This isn't really the place to get into it, so <a href="https://twitter.com/ArqaApocrypha/status/1349113928991834112?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>I'll leave you with a fun example</u></a>.</p><p>[00:04:56, 146] <strong>"Alright, Nagara and the team(...)"</strong> Mari is saying 長良っち, "<em>Nagara-'tchi</em>", a contracted form of "<em>Nagara-tachi</em>". Nagara is the helmswoman, and "<em>-tachi</em>" (a pluralizing suffix) is including any other relevant crew.</p>
<p><u>Dumb trivia:</u> back when Avant 1 first premiered as "Operation 0706", there was a mad rush to throw together <em>some </em>form of subtitling. Nobody with true fluency stepped up to the plate fast enough, so some of us at EGF were basically trying to minimize the damage from people running the French subtitles through Google Translate. (God, it was <em>bad.</em>) My listening comprehension was, and still is, rather limited, but I pushed it as far as I humanly could to make out the original wording whenever possible. This resulted in... some bits of weirdness. I didn't know about the contracted form of "-<em>tachi</em>" at the time, so I somehow convinced myself I was hearing "<em>puchi</em>" (petite). I.e., Mari, being herself and also being in Paris during this scene, had created some kind of neologistic diminutive  name suffix (sort of like -<em>cha</em>n, only... Frencher) right on the spot just to be weird and cute. I'm mildly disappointed this wasn't true; "Nagara-petite" was strangely endearing...</p><p>[00:05:58, 165] <strong>"Plus 20 to guiding. Keep the current tilt."</strong> There are couple of terms here where I'm unclear how they're being used in context, so I can't even say if the old translation is off. First up is in 「速度維持 トンボ位置 プラス２０」. トンボ位置 (<em>tompo ichi</em>) seems like it approximately means "crop mark positions", but what do crop marks (as in printing) have to do with anything here? I dunno. Next up is 「バカ棒、角度そのまま」. バカ棒 (<em>bakabou</em>) is a stick cut to a specific measurement that one needs to reference multiple times, as for construction. "<em>Bakabou, kakudo sonomam</em>a" would mean something like "maintain the angle of the idiot stick (<em>bakabou</em>)". Again, I'm completely stumped as to how that relates to anything in this scene.</p><p>[00:08:05, 206] <strong>"It's out! Time for the boss fight!"</strong> She literally says, "It came out! It's the boss character" (「出ました！ ボスキャラです」). You know, like in a video game. There are more verbal video game references later, so, awkward as this is, I figured it was worth preserving somehow. We don't (usually) say anything as specific as "boss character" in English, and, without a gaming context, "boss" on its own is too vague, but "Time for the boss fight!" makes the reference crystal clear.</p>
<p>[00:12:18, 258] <strong>"<em>Scrape together the parts we need for rebuilding Eva-02."</em></strong><em> </em>"Rebuilding" here is literally, like, "<em>new-</em>building" (新造, <em>shinzou</em>). My instinct upon seeing this term would be that it refers to something that is being created anew from scratch or something, whereas "New" Eva-02 is a case of "take whatever's left of your poor cyborg, strap it onto a Jet Alone, and call it a day". Not sure I quite understand why <em>shinzou</em> specifically gets used for this, but it won't be the last time we see the word in a head-scratching context in <em>Shin Eva</em>.</p>
<p>[00:12:22, 259] <strong>"Whatever gets the job done."</strong> You might recall "To the victor go the spoils" in the older subtitles, but in fact Mari is saying 「細工は流々」("<em>Saiku wa ryuuryuu"</em>), which is short for the proverb "<em>Saiku wa ryuuryuu, shiage wo gorou jiro.</em>" Handy little explanation <a href="http://kazuno.in.coocan.jp/99kotowaza/99sa/Saiku%20wa%20ryuuryuu,%20shiage%20wo%20gorou%20jiro.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>here</u></a>, but the gist is, "focus your criticisms on the finished product instead of the methodology used to get there". (Just a WEE bit meta. ;p ) I guess in context, Mari is acknowledging that Wille's methods are a bit messy and/or unorthodox, but as long as they get two working Evas out of it, nothing else much matters.</p>
<p>[00:12:24, 260] <strong>"</strong>(...) <strong>we can rebuild Eva-02 using cannibalized parts".</strong> 新造 (<em>shinzou</em>) appears again here (and expect to see it again in Pt.3). The literal phrasing is ニコイチ型２号機の新造, <em>nikoichigata Nigouki no shinzou</em>. <a href="https://kotobank.jp/word/%E4%BA%8C%E5%80%8B%E4%B8%80-2131441" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>Per Kotobank</u></a>, <em>nikoichi</em> means "The act of extracting usable parts from two or more pieces of used machinery and combining them to make a single product" (whereas "<em>-gata</em>" = model or type), in reference to how Eva-02 Improved's remains from the end of <em>Q</em> will be combined with Jet Alone 2 parts found in Paris. However... in standard Anno fashion, <em>nikoichi</em> has another meaning that will be relevant a bit later...</p>
<p>[00:12:52] <strong>"Other-Rei and Asuka walk ahead of him."</strong> "Other-Rei" is originally 別レイ (<em>Betsu-Rei</em>), literally "Different Rei" or "Another Rei". (I went with "Other-Rei" since it conveys the necessary information -- "other" meaning "different or distinct from the one or ones already mentioned or implied" -- while rolling off the tongue.) This is how "Tentative Name: Rei Ayanami" -- revealed later in this film as Rei #6 -- is referenced in the script for <em>Q</em>, and presumably <em>Shin</em>'s as well; so I assume the people who put the audio description together were given a copy of the script for reference purposes.</p>
<p>[00:21:10, 391]<strong> "Ikari... N3I wasn't <em>all</em> bad."</strong><em> Shin</em> introduces an abbreviated version of "Near Third Impact", <em>Nia Sā</em>, as in <em>Nia Sādo Impakuto</em> (<strong>ニアサー</strong>ドインパクト). So if you rendered this very literally, you'd wind up with "Near Thir" (lol). For I while I used "Near Third", but eventually I realized that this made no sense -- in English, you would just abbreviate "Near Third Impact" to "N3I", so in the translation I will do precisely that.</p><hr/><p><u>Return to Top</u> </p>
