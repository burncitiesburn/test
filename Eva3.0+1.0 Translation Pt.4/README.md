<p><strong>PART 4 START</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p>Pilot of Eva-01.</p>
<p>There's something I want to show you.</p>
<p>(Office.</p>
<p>A pitch-black giant is nailed to a cross.</p>
<p>There are two round eye holes in the white mask.)</p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p>It's... a black Lilith?</p>
<p>[01:52:59, 1739]</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p>That's how it appears in your memory, it seems.</p>
<p>Evangelion Imaginary.</p>
<p>Predicted by Dr. Katsuragi, it is a fictitious Eva that doesn't exist in the lower world.</p>
<p>Only humanity, an organism that believes in truth and fiction equally, is capable of perceiving it.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE: </strong>"lower world" = 現世 = Buddhist concept; investigate further.]</p>
<p>(In front of the black giant, the two spears fly past each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p>Together, the spears of hope and despair will become trigger and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Fiction and reality will melt together, becoming equal as everything is reduced to data.</p>
<p>[01:53:30]</p>
<p>(The entangled spears impale the giant's chest.</p>
<p>It turns pure white, and its hands pass through the nails that were holding them down.)</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p>And thus an Additional Impact that rewrites one's Gnosis</p>
<p>— that is, the world — will begin.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> "Gnosis" is a nerd translation of 認識 (<em>ninshiki</em>). This pedantry is intended in the same vein as Dan Kanemitsu translating 理 (<em>kotowari</em>) as "Logos". Have I succeeded at anything aside from confusing people, including myself? Dunno.]</p>
<p>(Eva Imaginary tumbles down.</p>
<p>Large amounts of fluid gush out from beneath the giant's feet,</p>
<p>and its upper body collapses into the swelling waves.</p>
<p>Shinji, standing stock-still, stares fixedly.)</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p>It's the only way to make my wish come true.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[01:53:59, 1753]</p>
<p>(Airspace where Wunder and Nerv warships are hovering.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>From the horizon line of the Gates of Guf, Lilith's white mask rises up like a full moon.</p>
<p>When about half of [Eva Imaginary] has come into view, the mask comes off, exposing the face of a giant Rei.</p>
<p>She opens eyes resembling light brown marbles wide, and pale blue hair ???s.)</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami (?):</strong></p>
<p>This is the Additional Impact?</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko: </strong></p>
<p>Yes. In all likelihood, that is the Eva Imaginary.</p>
<p>Hard to believe that it's real.</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>It's weird!</p>
<p>[01:54:29, 1761]</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(A wide-eyed Kitakami.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>Rei's eye stares back.)</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>Nothing could be weirder!</p>
<p>(The eye blinks.)</p>
<p><em>{Shattering sound}</em></p>
<p>(A giant explosion fills the space, and a shining golden world comes into view.)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(The surface.</p>
<p>Golden light suddenly shines in from beyond the horizon.DRAFTJS_BLOCK_KEY:9b2ld</p><figure><img src="images/87d07b_3f44552a5a6f4891a8959772f845fae6~mv2.jpg" srcset=""/></figure>

<p>[01:54:53, 1765]</p>
<p>(A marching swarm of Infinities, too, turns into headless Reis and keeps walking.</p>
<p>Their white bodies completely cover the red earth.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>They rise into the sky like a swelling cloud.)</p>
<p>***
</p>
<p>(Nerv warship. Fuyutsuki is looking outside.)</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>Mmm. So it's starting at last.</p>
<p>(Feet approaching behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>There you are.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>It's been a while, Fuyutsuki-sensei.</p>
<p>[01:55:31, 1771]</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Say... Isn't the L Barrier density too high on this ship?</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>It inherently lacks crew specifications.</p>
<p>I know it's futile.</p>
<p>People are constantly being filled with a light called "hope".</p>
<p>But it is also human nature to hold onto the sickness of hope,</p>
<p>and drown in it.</p>
<p>Both Ikari and I cling to that sickness far too tightly.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Hmm... Shinji is a "god of pestilence", Eva-01 is the "[Eva] unit of hope", hope is a "sickness"... What does Anno mean by this.]</p>
<p>[01:55:56, 1783]</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Gendo-kun is trying to make his wish come true...</p>
<p>by putting himself at the center of Instrumentality.</p>
<p>I'd like to help out... </p>
<p>No. I have a request. </p>
<p>I do understand how you feel, Fuyutsuki-sensei,</p>
<p>but I don't want all humankind to be involved.</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>So it seems.</p>
<p>My role ends here.</p>
<p>The things you wanted have been gathered.</p>
<p>Handle the rest as you see fit,</p>
<p>(The monitor turns off.)</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>Mary Iscariot-kun.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> The Japanese is "Ischariothe no Maria-kun" (イスカリオテのマリア君). "Maria" is how the Biblical name "Mary" is rendered in Japanese (and other languages, too, like Spanish). "Ischariothe no Juda" is how "Judas Iscariot" would be rendered. So I've naturalized it completely into the standard English forms used for the Bible.]</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Heh...</p>
<p>I haven't heard that name in a long time.</p>
<p>[01:56:29, 1801]</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Well, this is goodbye, then.</p>
<p>(Fuyutsuki, left behind in the dark ship interior, gazes at a photo of Yui holding an infant.)</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>Yui-kun... will this suffice?</p>
<p>(His head bursts and LCL scatters.)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(The earth's surface, wrapped in white by the swarms of headless Reis.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>The Rei bodies -- joined hand to hand high in the sky -- fly about in multiple circles.</p>
<p>The head of the Rei-shaped Eva Imaginary comes rising up from the horizon.)</p>
<p>***

[01:57:01, 1805]</p>
<p><em>{Sound of chains falling}</em></p>
<p>(Sparks flying and chains tumbling down into a hole.</p>
<p>From the operations block -- where a massive apparatus is being put worked on --,</p>
<p>a giant stretch of spinal column is put through the hole and dragged on down.)</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: This sounds dodgy and I can't even imagine what's supposed to be going on here. For the transcript, I have 「大型の機械が稼働する作業ブロックから　巨大な脊椎の連なりが　穴を通してずるずると下される」. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWGoquYI3X0&amp;t=7026s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>Hear the audio also.</u></a>]</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki(?):</strong></p>
<p>It worked. </p>
<p>We can do this!</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure>
<figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Captain, the crew here can handle the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>Understood.</p>
<p>All hands, abandon ship.</p>
<p><em>{Warning sound}</em></p>
<p>(Sakura and other crew rush a stretcher through a corridor.)</p>
<p><strong>Aoba (speakers):</strong></p>
<p>All hands, abandon ship!</p>
<p>Repeat: all hands, abandon ship!</p>
<p>[01:57:31, 1811]</p>
<p><strong>Aoba(?) (speakers):</strong></p>
<p>Prioritize accommodating the wounded!</p>
<p>Hurry to the escape capsules!</p>

<p>The full line-up of Eva Opfer Types,</p>
<p>a.k.a. the Adams' Vessels.</p>
<p>(Mark.10 opens up its mask.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Just the finesse you'd expect from Fuyutsuki-sensei.</p>
<p>(A fireball comes flying.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry, but I need you guys...</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Cutting through the sky,</p>
<p>Eva-08+09 does a flying kick to the second fireball.</p>
<p>It punches Mark.10 in the face.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>While grappling with Mark.10, it drops.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>...to become vittles for the overlapping.</p>
<p>Like so!</p>
<p>[01:58:01, 1825]
</p>
<p>(When it bares its teeth, it throws its head far back and bites into Mark.10's head.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Now we're 08+09+10!</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Mark.11 approaches in the background.</p>
<p>Eva-08+09+10 suddenly holds its hand up over its head.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Hah!</em></p>
<p><em>{Snarl}</em></p>
<p>(A powerful A.T. Field is generated that expands three-dimensionally.</p>
<p>It transforms into a giant beast.</p>

<p>...+11!</p>
<p>(Mark.10 drops with a thud nearby.)</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> No, that's not a mistake, the narrator really does say「 傍らでMark.10がバッタリと倒れる」. Why are Mark.10's uneaten remains dropping when you'd expect 11's to be doing that? I dunno.]</p>
<p>(Three halos manifest from Eva-08+09+10+11's back.</p>
<p>Mark.12 shrinks away.)</p>
<p>[01:58:30, 1833]</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Alright, let's go for the last one!</p>

<p>(Inside Wunder.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p>Closing hatches on first four escape capsules.</p>
<p>Those still on board, please hurry to capsule 5!</p>
<p>(Nagara inside a capsule. She contacts the secured lock.)</p>
<p><strong>Nagara:</strong></p>
<p>I'm going back to my post after all.</p>

<p>No matter how tough it gets.</p>

<p><em>Captain, the rearrangement work is complete.</em></p>
<p><em>I think this should do the trick.</em></p>
<p>[01:59:00, 1841]</p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>Roger.</p>
<p>Reroute all steering systems to the captain's chair. </p>
<p>After that, hurry and leave the ship.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Misato?</p>
<p><strong>Misato (comms):</strong></p>
<p>Somebody<em> sure as hell has to do this.</em></p>
<p><em>*</em></p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>And the person in charge of this ship is me.</p>
<p>(She takes off her sunglasses.)</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><strong>Misato (comms):</strong></p>
<p><em>I leave the survivors and the children in your hands, Ritsuko.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Understood, Misato.</p>
<p>I'll give it my best.</p>

(He<em> is</em>!)</p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p>Father, what do you want from this?</p>
<p>[02:00:56, 1860]</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p>A world of the human mind, where there is no A.T. Field, and all things exist in harmonious unity... </p>
<p>a world you did not choose. <u>↓</u> </p>
<p>Without differences between people.</p>
<p>Without class disparity, discrimination, strife, cruelty, pain, or sorrow.</p>
<p>A world comprised entirely of cleansed souls.</p>
<p>And a world of serenity where I will meet Yui again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Inside Gendo's mind.)</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>(At college, a hotel, the hospital, etc., there are the figures of plugsuit-clad girls.)</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Where are you, Yui?!&gt;</p>
<p>[02:01:30, 1869]</p>

<p>Father, just stop already.</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Why are you here, Shinji?</p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p>Because I want to know you, Father.</p>
<p>I never tried to get closer, even when I felt lonely.</p>
<p>I was scared to find out you really hated me. </p>
<p>But now I want to know.</p>
<p>About <em>you</em>, Father.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> Not 100% on 「嫌われているのが はっきりするのが怖かったんだ」. What I put down makes sense in context, at least.]</p>

<p>(Shinji approaches.</p>
<p>A rainbow-colored barrier appears before Gendo.)</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p>An A.T. Field.</p>
<p>Coming from the me who abandoned his humanity?</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> Verb here is implied. (発生される? 展開される? I dunno.) Japanese is just 「A.T.フィールド 人を捨てた この私に？」.]</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p>This me can't be afraid of Shinji,</p>
<p>can he?</p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>

<p>(Inside his mind.)</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>I hated the world, overflowing with people.</p>
<p>From a young age, solitude was my norm.</p>
<p>So, I never felt lonely.</p>
<p>But there are people in the world who don't approve of that.&gt;</p>
<p>[02:03:55, 1907]</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>I despised being brought to the households of my boring classmates and their families,</p>
<p>forced to learn about their lives and how they lived them.</p>
<p>Being with others was agony.</p>
<p>The fact is, I always wanted to be alone.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>One of those is knowledge.</p>
<p>I satiated my hungry mind with the unilateral procurement of knowledge.</p>
<p>With knowledge, there's nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>As long as you have time,</p>
<p>you can furnish yourself with as much as you please.&gt;</p>

<p>There are no lies in it. </p>
<p>There's no betrayal. No disappointment.</p>
<p>I'm quietly transformed into a stream of sound.&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Gendo:</strong></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>I relished my solitude.</p>
<p>Neither I nor anybody else got hurt. </p>
<p>Being alone was comfortable.</p>
<p>But then I met Yui and...&gt;</p>

<hr/><p><strong>PART 4 TO BE CONCLUDED</strong></p><hr/><h3>Extended Notes</h3>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Given the Escalation Into Vagueness that happens in Pt. 4, the notes will feature more of my offbeat interpretations than I might prefer. I could probably create "less biased" explanations if I tried hard enough, but I'm not sure it's necessary, since my own thought process binds others' much less than you might think. </p>
<p>[02:00:56, 1860] <strong>"A world of the human mind, (...) a world you did not choose." </strong>Original line here is 「お前が選ばなかったA.T.フィールドの存在しないすべてが等しく単一な人類の心の世界」.  It's another difficult Gendo line and many thanks again go to Nicholas Miari (see comments) for helping me make a bit more sense out of it. Now the question is, when did Shinji have the option of choosing such a world, but declined? Did I miss something, or is this intentionally obfuscatory?</p>
<p>[02:08:52, 1968] <strong>"With the fulfillment of my hopes comes my karma."</strong> I'm leaving 報い (<em>mukui</em>) as the more ambiguous "karma", which can be good <em>or</em> bad. <a href="https://kotobank.jp/gs/?q=%E5%A0%B1%E3%81%84" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>Kotobank</u></a> says that <em>mukui</em> is more commonly used nowadays to refer to the consequences of bad behavior, but remember that we're dealing with <em>Eva</em>, where seemingly contradictory interpretations frequently exist in harmony, and Anno's attitude seems to be "the more the merrier". Gendo does refer unambiguously to "punishment" below, but he also qualifies it with "I felt that...". Incidentally, <em>mukui</em> is also the word that Gendo used before getting half-eaten in EoE; the ambiguity is especially delicious -- no pun intended -- in that situation...</p>
<p><strong>[02:09:56] </strong><strong>"He is the center of Instrumentality this time. The source of the rings."</strong> Super mysterious shit. The middle lines here are 「彼が 今回の補完の中心。円環の元だ」.  <strong>"This time" (</strong>今回) feels like it could be a (partial) reference to <a href="https://www.arqacrypha.net/post/eva-3-0-1-0-cc-ad-translation-pt-3#viewer-927uh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>Gendo's earlier revelation</u></a> that Dr. Katsuragi was the brains behind the Human Instrumentality Project, a hypothesis he verified through through Second Impact. That is, in <em>Eva</em>'s grand tradition of repetition, Katsuragi was the center of the form of Instrumentality that took place at 2I. (More on this <a href="https://twitter.com/ArqaZone/status/1379466520716279813?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>here</u></a> and <a href="https://www.arqacrypha.net/post/last-minute-pre-release-rant-5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>here</u></a>.) </p>
<p>円環の元 (<em>enkan no moto</em>) <em>could</em> be translated as something like "the origin of the circle", but this gives the entirely wrong idea. 円環 refers specifically to the <em>shape</em> -- a circle, ring, or torus -- and not to "cycles" in a more metaphorical or metaphysical sense. (A less specific term would be 輪 (<em>wa</em>); a more specific one would be 輪廻 (<em>rin'ne</em>), which is "samsara", or the endless cycle of death and rebirth.) I was initially puzzled by 円環の元, but the aforementioned Dr. Katsuragi / 8th Angel link gave the game away pretty quickly. To be at the center of HIP is also to be at the center of the Gates of Guf, generating its ripples into space-time. </p>
<p>It also just so happens that the Gates of Guf phenomenon is torus-shaped, as well, so<em> that</em> could be potentially used in translation here. However, I'll save "torus" for the <u>next incidence</u> of <em>enkan</em>. </p>
<p>[02:10:41, 1992] <strong>"I have to be okay with no one being around."</strong> Tricky line (at least, it is for idiots like me). Original is 「誰もいなくていいようにする」 (<em>Daremo inakute ii you ni suru</em>) . This didn't really make any sense in context at all until I tried separating it into "<em>Daremo inakute ii</em>" and "<em>you ni suru</em>", yielding something like, "I will try to be okay with no one being here", which I then simplified a little for readability. </p>
<p>[02:13:28, 2028]<strong> "That's why we piloted the same Eva as you."</strong> Like basically everything else in this scene, this line -- 「だから同じエヴァに乗っていたんだね 」-- is fucking obnoxious. It doesn't specify an actual subject, just the action of piloting -- literally "getting on board" -- the same Eva. Now, from context alone, you might expect that Shinji is referring back to the last two subjects mentioned, Kaworu and Gendo; thus, Kaworu and Gendo being alike is why the two of them "piloted" the same Eva. But, wait! Shinji piloted Eva 13 as well, and the scenery here also hearkens back to Shinji's "sync training" in <em>Q</em>, so is there any possibility that he's been implicitly included in this comparison? For now, I'll go with a translation that enhances the vagueness to the max.</p>
<p>[02:14:25, 2043]<strong> </strong><strong>"My existence can only be erased by vacuum decay."</strong> Superficially baffling, but AFAIK this is just a way of saying that Kaworu's "existence" -- however exactly the parameters of that are defined -- is bound to the universe as we know it, and cannot be destroyed unless the universe as a whole is destroyed. <a href="https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/vacuum-decay-ultimate-catastrophe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>Basic primer here</u></a>. At first, this might not seem to tie into anything; but, for starters, think back earlier to when Asuka was standing in front of Eva 13, asserting that the Eva could only be forced into inactivity, not be destroyed...</p>
<p>[02:14:29, 2044]<strong> </strong><strong>"And so I am bound to eternally repeat my part within the predetermined toroidal narrative."</strong> This line -- in Japanese, 「だから 僕は定められた円環の物語の中で演じることを永遠に繰り返さなければならない --  is another doozy. "Torus" here is the same term in Japanese as Kaworu's "rings" <u>from earlier</u>, 円環, <em>enkan</em>. Look up "torus physics", "toroidal motion", "toroidal universe", and similar such things; and remember that the physics-inspired woo-woo is part of the fun. For those of us operating outside of a sequelist or looper mindset, I suspect this line will be instrumental in tracking down many of NTE's less obvious sources of inspiration and deciphering the movies' metaphysical laws. There's a lot of nerdy investigative work to do! (David Bohm's work is one possible lead.) </p>
<p>[02:14:53, 2047] <strong>"You long for a world of complementarity. Shinji-kun, you never change."</strong> The first line doesn't specify who's doing the hoping. I would assume from context that Kaworu is referring to Shinji and not to himself, so, for now, that is what I'll go with. </p>
<p>Though it sounds similar in English, "complementarity" here is 相補性 (<em>souhosei</em>), referring to the physics concept, not to the usual Eva complementation/Instrumentality, or 補完 (<em>hokan</em>). The ideas are related (note the shared kanji, 補, in both terms), though I'm not entirely clear on the specifics of "complementarity" and what it means for the world of NTE. Something to look further into. For an important bit of context, the term was also mentioned by Ritsuko toward the end of <em>Ha</em>, when she mentioned Eva-01's "swells of complementarity".</p>
<p>[02:14:59, 2048] <strong>"That's why you chose him and listed his name in the Book of Life."</strong> In Japanese, 「だからこそ あなたが彼を選び生命の書に名を書き連ねた」. The verb Kaji is using indicates that a name isn't simply written once, but a list is made, i.e., the "writing of the name in the book" is something that happens repeatedly. This might simply be referring to repeated iterations of "Shinji Ikari", but it also introduces the possibility that names other than "Shinji Ikari" -- e.g. incarnations of the same soul -- are included as well. Of course, this being Japanese, it doesn't have to specify <em>how</em> many different names are listed; whether one or many, you simply say 名 (<em>na</em>). </p>
<p>[02:15:17, 2053] <strong>"The shore (...) is the interstice between sea and land; (...)"</strong> These lines were a bit nightmarish to render, and can still stand for some improvement. Trying to explain the translation would be a nightmare unto itself. But I'll attempt it, all the same. To start with, here's the original Japanese. It's a little hard to know where the exact sentence cut-offs are (without audio, anyway), so I won't even try.</p>
<p>(2053)</p>
<p>渚とは 海と陸のはざま</p>
<p>(2054)</p>
<p>第 1 の使徒であり</p>
<p>第13の使徒となる</p>
<p>(2055)</p>
<p>人類のはざまを紡ぐ</p>
<p>あなたらしい 名前だ</p>
<p>For an attempt at a basic interpretational primer... Kaji first states what a shore is; it's the transitional area between water and land that is, in a sense, both. He elaborates further, comparing this "interstice between sea and land" to Kaworu's existence as "the 1st Angel who will become the 13th". The 1st Angel here is the "sea", and the 13th is the "land". This is reinforced by the visuals, wherein the angel or goddess statue from NGE reappears, most likely serving once again as a symbol for Kaworu's original divine self. When Kaworu is sitting upon the statue's headless neck, note the statue is in the water; later, when Kaworu breaks free of the "rising from his coffin" visual allegory for "repeating the same part over and over", he appears on the beach instead...<em> the land</em>. Either side of the threshold could be considered the "shore", and, since Kaworu is "the shore", he appears on both sides as a signifier of his dual nature. </p>
<p>"A name that spins the threads of humanity together" is quite dense in its implications. For me, the only way that this makes any sense is if it's proceeding logically from what came before. </p><ul>
<li>1st Angel and 13th Angel, sea and land, become the same at the shore, where they meet. </li>
<li>The shore is Kaworu Nagisa. </li>
<li>Kaworu Nagisa is something that binds humanity in general together.</li>
<li>What is the 1st Angel? Probably Adam, a divine being of light, immortal and incapable of being destroyed.</li>
<li>What is the 13th? Adam's fallen form, embodied within a Lilin-shaped vessel, capable of physically dying.</li>
<li>Therefore, 1st/sea is divinity, and 13th/land is mortality. The "shore" binds the divine side of humanity to its mortal side.</li>
<li>Another important observation is that, in one sense, what comes between the "sea" of the 1st and the "land" of the 13th is the 2nd through 12th Angels. The "threads of humanity" being brought together could thus be considered all the other Angels. Adam/Kaworu's existence is something that unifies them all. Yes, this means that we're indirectly getting confirmation that all Angels are human. (BUT ARE LILIN ANGELS?!?)</li>
</ul><p>If you don't see things this way, that's fine; I'm just trying to walk through my own attempt to puzzle through these lines, in the event it helps at all.</p>
<p>[02:15:04, 2049] <strong>"You saved me too, Ryo-chan."</strong> Referring to Kaji's sacrifice at Third Impact and implying Kaworu might have died along with everyone else if Kaji hadn't done that? Or is Kaworu saying that he was saved by Kaji in addition to Shinji ("too"), which would provide a link, however mysterious, to Kaji's line about Kaworu choosing Shinji and listing his name in the "Book of Life" -- implying that Kaji "saved" Shinji in some way that we don't know about directly? Or... all/none of the above? Very unclear. Note that Kaworu uses a form of 救う (<em>sukuu</em>) here, the same verb that Shinji did when talking about why he wouldn't cry anymore, so keep possible double-meanings in mind.</p>
<p>[02:15:28, 2057] <strong>"He can take over from here, don't you think?"</strong> More Vague Vagueness. Kaji's two lines here are 「あなたは 十分に使命を果たした。あとは 彼に引き継いでもらってもいいでしょう」. Which mission? Who is "he"? What does "taking over" entail? My suspicion at the moment is that there are two possible readings here, one for Shinji and one for Gendo. </p>
<p>For the Shinji side, <strong>jhonsonlopez</strong> suggests in the comments that Kaworu's mission was to restore the Earth, and Shinji will finish the rest. A straightforward interpretation, and I agree that this is one of the intended options. </p>
<p>For the Gendo one: Kaji is perhaps saying, "You did what you came to do, so you don't have to be Adam anymore; let Gendo take over." Gendo is the only soul inhabiting Eva 13 at the end, ergo at that point he has truly become the Eva. He then uses the Spear of Gaius on Yui/Eva-01 and himself, and they vanish along with the other Evas. The start of their own weird Adam and Eve story, somewhere far away from Earth? Seems like a rather <em>Eva</em> thing to do.</p>
<p>[02:15:38, 2058]<strong> </strong><strong>"How about spending (y)our golden years with Katsuragi, working the fields?" </strong>Those who have seen the movie and can also actually speak the language (unlike<em> some</em> people /self-diss) have shared the impression that Kaji is implicitly including himself when he says this to Kaworu. Perhaps I should go along with it, tentatively, but I have SO MANY QUESTIONS -- why does Kaji suggest this? why does Kaworu agree? why is this, of all things, used to conclude Kaworu's HIP segment? what is that scamp Anno up to?!? -- that I'm going to leave it as the rather unseemly "(y)our" for now. Schrödinger's Kaji. </p>
<p>"Golden years" is literally "old age". Is Kaji saying that Kaworu and Misato (and himself) are old? Or is he saying that they wait until they're old to pursue his suggestion? What about the biological age gap between them -- do they both need to be old before they do it, or just one of them? Is this more of a figurative thing, like "retirement" rather than literal "period in life after you get old"? Or is Anno fucking with us and all this is all code for something weirder than we can possibly imagine? Beats me.</p><hr/><p><u>Return to Top</u> </p>
