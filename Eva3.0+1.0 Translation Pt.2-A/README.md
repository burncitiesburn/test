<p><em>{Helicopter rotors}</em></p>
<p>(The village square.</p>
<p>A giant transport ship stretches ahead imposingly.) </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Unclear if one or many transports are being discussed in this scene.]</p>
<p><em>{Cranes being operated}</em></p>
<p>(Cranes and forklifts move around, unloading relief supplies.)</p>
<p><strong>Worker: </strong></p>
<p>OK... OK... OK... </p>
<p>(Men are conducting checks alongside a procession of massive trucks. </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>An intense-looking Toji provides instructions.</p>

<p>[00:53:01, 855]</p>
<p><strong>Kensuke:</strong></p>
<p>So that's the Wunder. </p>
<p>It's <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>(The screen displays a transport ship right under the mother ship that hovers in the sky.) </p>
<p><strong>Kensuke:</strong></p>
<p>All interested parties are disembarking. </p>
<p>The climactic battle has come at last. </p>
<p>(He swings the camera to the side, catching Asuka beside him.) </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Uh, please no. Don't film me.</p>
<p><strong>Kensuke:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>But <em>just</em> today, I'd like to make a record for posterity. </p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Alright. Have a blast, then. </p>
<p><em>{Dog barking}</em></p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p><em>Ugh...</em></p>
<p>(When the camera pans some more, Shinji comes into view. </p>
<p>He looks in Kensuke and Asuka's direction.) </p>
<p>[00:53:32, 863]</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>And? What are <em>you </em>doing here?</p>
<p>(Shinji stares back with weepy eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Kensuke:</strong></p>
<p>Ikari, it's okay if you stay behind.</p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Kensuke.</p>
<p>Give Toji and the others my thanks, too.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(His grip tightens around the music player.) </p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p>Asuka, I'm going too.</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Okay. </p>
<p>Then I gotta do this; regulations and all. </p>
<p>(She shoots him with a taser.) </p>
<p>[00:53:58, 869]</p>
<p><em>{Discharge sound}</em></p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p><em>Ugh...</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Sickbay.</p>
<p>A blurred field of vision focuses, </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>and the face of a woman wearing a beret comes into view.)</p>
<p><strong>Shinji: </strong></p>
<p><em>Ugh...</em></p>
<p>Suzuhara... Sakura-san?</p>
<p>(She slaps the bed-ridden Shinji.) </p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p>Running off as you please!</p>
<p>I told you not to pilot more Evas but you went and did it anyway! </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Sakura is in full Kansaiben Mode here. In <em>Q</em>, she only briefly let a "<em>honma</em>" slip out when she was telling Shinji not to do THE THING.] </p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p>Moron! Dimwit! </p>
<p>Ikari-san, you're such a dumb-ass! <u>↓</u> </p>
<p>(She clings to his chest.)</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset="" title="(Sorry, not sorry.)"/></figure><p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Are you his wife?</p>
<p>(Asuka is next to them.) </p>
<p><em>{Sakura crying}</em></p>
<p>(She firmly fixes her gaze upon Shinji, who inquiringly tries to feel for the base of his neck.) </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[00:54:29, 879]</p>
<p>(Outside a door.</p>
<p>Sakura and Asuka watch a hospital gurney being led out of sight.)</p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p>Verification of the escapee has been completed. </p>
<p>As of now, we assume responsibility for BM-03's surveillance hold.</p>
<p>(Asuka casually throws her hands up.) </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: I assume this is like a "he's <em>all</em> yours!" kind of gesture, but I'm not 100% sure.]</p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p>Sign here for the transfer, Wartime Special Major Shikinami.</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>What about a DSS choker?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>(The bed advances in a corridor.) </p>
<p>*</p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p>It's fine if it's not equipped. </p>
<p>He'll be housed in the explosion-proof isolation ward until all operations have concluded. </p>
<p>*</p>
<p><strong>Announcement: </strong></p>
<p><em>Monitored subject BM-03 arriving at Chamber 2.</em> </p>
<p>(The security officers and the bed disappear inside.)</p>
<p>[00:55:01, 886]</p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>Preparing ignition system.</em></p>
<p><em>*</em></p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Seeing as he removed the choker at his convenience...</p>
<p>This is a more secure way of dealing with the issue, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p>The choker left a history of its activity in Magi C.</p>
<p>That tells us that another pilot was killed by the detonation, right before his eyes.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE: </strong>The "C" is pronounced "Copy".]</p>
<p>*</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset="" title="(This goes around here somewhere.)"/></figure><p>(The bed rises to a vertical.) </p>
<p>*</p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p>Returning to the Wunder even after experiencing something like that...</p>
<p>(Shinji's restraints disengage.) </p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>No idea.</p>
<p>If you ask me, Captain Katsuragi giving him clearance to come aboard is the more pressing mystery. </p>
<p>[00:55:30, 897]</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Here's the documentation of Village-3 that our contact put together.</p>
<p>Also, a letter for you from Suzuhara.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p>From my brother?</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(It comes with a photo of Toji's family.)</p>
<p><strong>Sakura:</strong></p>
<p><em>Ah...</em></p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>Chamber 2 fully locked down and emergency ignition system initiated.</em></p>
<p><em>{Sakura weeping} </em>[~5 sec.]</p>
<p>(Asuka takes her leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>Monitored subject BM-03 successfully placed in isolation.</em></p>
<p><em>{Sakura crying}</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Wunder in outer space.</p>
<p>Within a tunnel, the shuttle switches to another track and moves along.</p>
<p>Ibuki is inside.)</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Ibuki: </strong></p>
<p>No issues compensating for the crew who disembarked.</p>
<p>Things are proceeding smoothly at N-02's work site, </p>
<p>so start integrating the power shift into Improved 08 as planned.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTES</strong>: N-02 = N-Eva-02 = New Eva-02. Also, I'm not entirely sure what "power shift" or "powershift" refers to, but "power-shifting" is a car term, at least. Are they turning Eva-08 into a car? *<em>thinks about the steering wheel in Avant 1 and also how Utena turned into a pink car in the </em>Adolescence of Utena<em> movie and gets a funny feeling</em>*]</p>
<p>[00:56:00, 908]</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Status of main gun turrets and outboard operations? </p>
<p><strong>Worker A:</strong></p>
<p><em>No issues replacing turret 4 or adding the main armament to the stern.</em></p>
<p><strong>Worker B:</strong></p>
<p><em>Eva-related work in the outboard docks is about 3% behind, all in all.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p>Expedite things. </p>
<p>Skip over one-fifth of the checks. </p>
<p><strong>Workers:</strong></p>
<p><em>Yes, ma'am!</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Bridge.) </p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>Five minutes until phase 2 of N1 rocket attachment resumes.</em></p>
<p>(Kitakami having a meal.</p>
<p>Aoba and Tama are also present.)  </p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>I'm glad Major Shikinami is back on board,</p>
<p>but why'd we take the jinx, too? </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE:</strong> Midori literally says 疫病神, <em>yakubyougami</em>, or god of pestilence. (lol) I tried to naturalize it a bit.]</p>
<p><strong>Aoba:</strong></p>
<p>Just leave it alone. </p>
<p>Better he's with us than getting used by Nerv again. </p>
<p>[00:56:28, 919]</p>
<p><strong>Tama:</strong></p>
<p>If he tries to pilot an Eva, all personnel get unconditional use of firearms. </p>
<p>We'll be fine this time around.</p>
<p><strong>[NOTE:</strong> The previous three sets of lines have been tweaked based on Nuclear Lunchbox's commentary <a href="https://forum.evageeks.org/post/924660/Shin-Eva-General-Reborn/#924660" target="_blank">,<u>here</u></a>. These sorts of explanations are always lovely and much appreciated.]</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>You're so full of it.</p>
<p>When he escaped the last time, the captain couldn't do what she needed to.</p>
<p>So now I've got no faith in her at all. </p>
<p>(Nagara looks over her shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Nagara:</strong></p>
<p>We're talking about a kid.</p>
<p>It makes sense that she hesitated.</p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>That <em>kid</em> caused N3I and killed my entire family!</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Hyuga:</strong></p>
<p>N3I wasn't the outcome that he intended. </p>
<p>(The bespectacled Hyuga.) </p>
<p><strong>Hyuga:</strong></p>
<p>The Captain has committed herself completely to atonement as well.</p>
<p>(Takao, at center.) </p>
<p><strong>Takao:</strong></p>
<p>Quite right.</p>
<p>She's the one Kaji entrusted Wille to.</p>
<p>I stand by our captain, come hell or high water. </p>
<p>[00:57:00, 930]</p>
<p>(Kitakami looks away stubbornly.) </p>
<p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>People are too soft on family and friends. </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(There's a water pack in her hand.)</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Kitakami:</strong></p>
<p>It's like this reclaimed water. Could be anyone's pee, </p>
<p>but people act like that doesn't matter, long as it's purified. </p>
<p><em>What planet is everyone on?!</em></p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: I <em>think</em> Midori is making some kind of absurd metaphor comparing nepotism to drinking recycled piss, but it's a bit difficult for me to find the right formulation in English.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Explosion-proof isolation ward. The airtight door opens lengthwise, and Asuka proceeds further within.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>No problems detected during linkage test between the JA parts and N-Eva-02.</em></p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(She walks right up to the room and then peers behind the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>As planned, please begin work on the left wrist's standalone interlocking system.</em></p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>There are more explosives.</p>
<p>Less confidence in <em>us</em>, huh? </p>
<p>(The place is rigged with red devices.) </p>
<p>[00:57:30, 938]</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>I'm home.</p>
<p>(Mari embraces her.) </p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Welcome home, Princess.</p>
<p>The toil of your journey was not in vain.</p>
<p>I've missed you <em>très</em> much.<u>↓</u> </p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Seriously?! What's with the room? </p>
<p>You didn't clean up, you just stuffed it with more books!</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>Books are aggregates of humanity's wisdom. </p>
<p>Reading every book from around the world, past and present, that I can get my hands on... </p>
<p>That's my impossible dream. </p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p>By the way,</p>
<p>how are things coming along with Puppy Boy?</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Meh, don't care.</p>
<p>(She's holding a game console.)</p>
<p><strong>Mari:</strong></p>
<p><em>Oh?</em></p>
<p>So you're not interested in boys his age?</p>
<p>[00:58:01, 949]</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>The brat needs a mother, not a lover. </p>
<p>***</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Zoological-Botanical Seed Storage Block.) </p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>All transfers from the supply ships to the main ship are complete.</em></p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Misato is looking at a container. </p>
<p>The name "Kaji" is written on a plate.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>Logistics personnel on the supply ships are to promptly withdraw.</em></p>
<p>(Ritsuko comes up on a lift.) </p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Sign here to authorize Kredit's independent administration along with the release of all limiters on both Evas,</p>
<p>Captain Katsuragi. </p>
<p>(Misato holds her palm over the electronic pad.)</p>
<p><em>{Electronic sound}</em></p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Authorization of both the captain and executive officer verified.</p>
<p>Maya, please get started.</p>
<p><strong>Ibuki:</strong></p>
<p><em>Roger, XO-sempai.</em></p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(The lift goes down the precipice of containers.) </p>
<p>[00:58:31, 959]</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>You're always here when you're alone, Misato.</p>
<p>We ought to put the plate for the captain's room here instead.</p>
<p>Your feelings for Ryo-chan can't be pushed aside so easily, can they?</p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>It has nothing to do with Kaji.</p>
<p>I feel at peace here, that's all. </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>This block embodies the ship's underlying practical purpose, to preserve the seeds of all life.<u>↓</u> </p>
<p>An unmanned, fully automated ark capable of semipermanent operations, dedicated to safeguarding those seeds -- </p>
<p>that is the true nature of the AAA Wunder.</p>
<p>[00:59:00, 967]</p>
<p><strong>Misato: </strong></p>
<p>Kaji didn't concern himself with the long-term prospects of the human species.</p>
<p>We would go extinct, collateral of the Instrumentality Project.</p>
<p>Ensuring that biodiversity remained in the natural world was of the utmost importance. </p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>And to accomplish that, as many life seeds would need to be evacuated off Earth as possible. </p>
<p>This ship was stolen from Nerv while it was still under construction so this plan could be realized. </p>
<p>We all had doubts about humanity's ability to hinder the Instrumentality Project. </p>
<p>[00:59:29, 976]</p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>But no sooner had we pulled the heist than he threw his own life away to stop Third Impact. </p>
<p>(Misato wearing sunglasses.) </p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>He was an exasperating man who died a paradoxical, opportunistic death. </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Ritsuko stares at the in-profile Misato.</p>
<p>Interior of an inclined elevator.) </p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>And as a result, he's no longer here.</p>
<p>So I will use this ship to wipe Nerv off the map </p>
<p>and stop the Human Instrumentality Project dead in its tracks.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Out of vengeance? </p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>Instead of being an ark that preserves lives for the future, </p>
<p>it will be a combat vessel that saves them in the here and now.</p>
<p>[01:00:01, 984]</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Spoken like a true mother. </p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>Must be mistaking me for someone else. </p>
<p>(The elevator stops.</p>
<p>An airtight door opens.</p>
<p>Inside the bridge.</p>
<p>Kitakami keenly looks up toward Misato.) </p>
<p><strong>Aoba:</strong></p>
<p>Captain and XO now present on the navigation bridge. </p>
<p><strong>Announcement:</strong></p>
<p><em>Nerv Headquarters has started moving.</em></p>
<p><em>Presumed to be heading for ground zero of the former South Pole, </em></p>
<p><em>accompanied by a soaring Black Moon.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(The surface.)</p>
<p>[01:00:25, 990]</p>
<p><em>{Impact}</em></p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(A black mass, soaring high in the sky, rises while gouging the red Mt. Fuji out of the ground.</p>
<p>A thick, bright red cloud of dust billows up.</p>

<p>the inverted pyramid-shaped Nerv HQ levitates, accompanied by a ring of light.)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Fuyutsuki, inside headquarters.) </p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>The resurrection of the Black Moon, cornerstone of Fourth Impact.</p>
<p>And... the sacrificial offering of the Adams' Vessels, unsullied life-forms made only of pure soul, neither male nor female.</p>
<p>(There's more than one [of the Vessels? Ayanamis?].)</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>The revival of the Advanced Ayanami Series.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: "Revival" could also be "resuscitation", "rebirth", "reincarnation", or "resurrection".]</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>The human salvation of humanity, the Human Instrumentality Project.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(One of the Ayanami Series blinks.)</p>
<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>And <em>this</em> is the culmination of your hubris. </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure>
<figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Gendo stands before Evangelion 13, which is impaled upon two spears.</p>

<p><strong>Fuyutsuki:</strong></p>
<p>The Third Boy returned to Wille. </p>
<p>It appears that Ayanami Type No. 6,  due to a lack of calibration, could not hold onto her individuality. </p>
<p>Was the goal to make your son experience the same loss as you, Ikari?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Inside Wunder.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>Shinji is looking at the music player in his hands.) </p>

<p>(Captain's room.)</p>
<p>[01:01:34, 1001]</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>He's emotionally stable, it would seem. </p>
<p>(An observation monitor shuts off.) </p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>So, Captain Katsuragi,</p>
<p>how will you deal with our provisionally named Ikari Shinji-kun? </p>
<p>Are you intent on never seeing him, just like your son?</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Ritsuko's phrasing -- 「息子と同じく一生会わない気？」 -- is kind of weird, since it seems like she's implying that Misato has never met with "Provisional Shinji" before, when Misato did in fact speak to him in <em>Q</em>. It wasn't much, but it was presumably way more than Ryoji Jr. ever got.]</p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>Having him protected on the ship is enough. </p>
<p>There's no need for me to meet with him.  </p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Are you sure you want to leave the DSS Choker unequipped? </p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>Without the willful intent to make up for one's sins, atonement is meaningless.</p>
<p>[01:01:57, 1008]</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>Misato, for all the airs you're putting on, </p>
<p>aren't you happy he came back, deep down?</p>
<p>(Misato leaves her back turned to Ritsuko.) </p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>You know from experience that bad things happen when your emotions take the reins. </p>
<p><em>(Misato sighing)</em></p>
<p><strong>Misato:</strong></p>
<p>You're as brutal as ever.</p>
<p><strong>Ritsuko:</strong></p>
<p>It doesn't end well when I pamper you, Misato.</p>
<p><em>I</em> know that from experience. </p>

<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Aside from my hair growing, my body doesn't really change at all. </p>

<p>ONWARD TO PART 2-B?　<a href="https://www.arqacrypha.net/post/eva-3-0-1-0-cc-ad-translation-pt-2" target="_self"><u>⇒</u></a> </p><hr/><h3>Extended Notes</h3>
<p>[00:55:52, 874~5] <strong>"Moron! Dimwit! Ikari-san, you're such a dumb-ass!"</strong> Sakura says 「アホ！アホ！碇さんのどアホウ！」 (<em>Aho! Aho! Ikari-san no do-ahou!</em>).  <em>Aho(u)</em> is like the Kansaiben version of <em>baka</em>; <em>do-aho(u)</em> is an intensified version of that. According to the book <em>Colloquial Kansai Japanese</em>, "women need to pay special attention to usage and tone to avoid sounding unladylike [and will] usually avoid saying <em>aho</em> directly to the person they are criticizing." So, on account of the usually-polite and well-spoken Sakura lapsing into her original dialect and calling somebody an <em>aho</em> to his face, using "dumb-ass" for <em>do-haou</em> felt justified. </p>
<p>[00:57:32, 939-940] <strong>"(...) I've missed you <em>très</em> much." </strong>As weird as this sounds, it's an attempt to approximate the quirkiness of Mari's speech patterns. Here, we get variations on two customary expressions (one of them relatively formal) combined with an idiosyncratic nickname, followed by more "normal" speech that has random English thrown in. (Mari uses the word "very", which brought to mind how one might occasionally see "<em>très</em>" or "<em>mucho</em>" thrown into English. I picked the French option for what are probably obvious reasons.) There really is no science to translating stuff like this; a lot of it is experimenting with possibilities and trying to find what feels right.</p>
<p>[00:58:45, 963] <strong>"(...), to preserve the seeds of all life."</strong> Ritsuko uses a phrase here, 生命の種 (<em>seimei no tane</em>), which literally means "seeds of life" / "life seeds", but the "<em>tane</em>" (seed) part can also mean "cause" or "source". The kanji 種, read as <em>shu</em> rather than <em>tane</em>, can also refer to a biological species (or, less formally, "kind" or "variety"). The movie plays around with this three-way meaning, just as you would expect. The design of the "life seed" evacuation capsules later in the movie drives the point in especially hard.</p>
<p>If "seeds of life" sounds familiar, that's because<em> seimei no tane</em> is the term used in <em>Evangelion 2</em> to refer to beings such as Adam and Lilith. You've probably come across the "Classified Information" from that game, or people referencing said document; for the C.I., I translated <em>seimei no tane</em> as "Seeds of Life". (Yep, I was the main translator behind that! Time sure flies, don't it?) The fact that the term appears in <em>Shin Evangelion</em> in a context paralleling the "giant progenitor humanoid god"-type Seeds of Life -- that is to say, the First Ancestral Race created Seeds of Life to ensure the existence of humanity and other life-forms beyond the viability of their own world, and with Wille's plan here we see something analogous put into play using these "life seeds" -- may indicate that Alfa Systems, the creators of <em>Eva 2</em>, did indeed get "Seed of Life" and other such details straight from Anno himself. The matter has been hotly contested over the years, with no real definitive answer to my knowledge, so it's just something to think about.</p>
<p>[01:03:54, 1034] <strong>"Captain, bad news. (...) I also have good news."</strong> Ritsuko says both "bad news" and "good news" in English. Incidentally, the Greek word "evangelion" is sometimes represented in English by the literal translation "good news". Coincidence? The "bad news" is about the "bad Eva" and the "good news" is about the "good Evas", so... probably not. For a fun bit of trivia, the opposite of "Evangelion" would be "Dysangelion". Neat.</p><hr/><p><u>Return to Top</u> </p>
