<p>(Other-Rei comes into the clinic.)</p>
<p><em>{Door opens and closes}</em></p>
<p><strong>Boy:</strong></p>
<p>Oh. You're not Mommy.</p>
<p><strong>Hikari:</strong></p>
<p>Welcome back, Look-alike.</p>
<p>Thanks for your hard work today.</p>
<p><em>{Door opening}</em></p>
<p><strong>Mother:</strong></p>
<p>Sorry it took me so long. </p>
<p><strong>Boy:</strong></p>
<p><em>Ah!</em></p>
<p>Yaaay, it's Mommy!</p>
<p>(The young boy slips past [Other-Rei].)</p>
<p><strong>Mother:</strong></p>
<p>Have you been a good boy?</p>
<p><strong>Boy:</strong></p>
<p>Yep!</p>
<p><em>*giggling*</em></p>
<p><strong>Mother:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks again, Hikari. </p>
<p><strong>Hikari:</strong></p>
<p>My pleasure. </p>
<p>We're all in this together.</p>
<p><strong>Mother:</strong></p>
<p>Well, let's head on home.</p>
<p><strong>Boy:</strong></p>
<p>Okay! </p>
<p>Bye-bye. </p>
<p>[00:28:00, 538]</p>
<p><strong>Hikari:</strong></p>
<p>Goodbye. Take care. </p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>What is "goodbye"?</p>
<p><strong>Hikari:</strong></p>
<p>Let's see... </p>
<p>It's a magic word that lets people meet again.</p>
<p><em>*titters*</em></p>
<p><strong>Boy:</strong></p>
<p>Hurry up, Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>Mother:</strong></p>
<p><em>Co-</em>ming! </p>
<p>(The mother and the boy join hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Boy:</strong></p>
<p>Let's go home and play!</p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: She's referring to the hand-holding, though it's not terribly clear.]</p>
<p><strong>Hikari:</strong></p>
<p>Well, it's a magic trick for becoming good friends with someone. </p>
<p><em>*chuckles* </em></p>
<p>(Other-Rei looks at her extended hand.</p>
<p>The plugsuit-covered hand grasps repeatedly.) </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Morning. Kensuke's house.</p>
<p>A train is floating near the watchtower.) </p>
<p>[00:28:29, 545]</p>
<p>(Asuka ditches the game console on her bed. </p>
<p>In the workshop, she looks down upon Shinji.)</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>I've had it with your shit.</p>
<p><em>Argh!</em></p>
<p>(She kicks him in the back.)</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>It's been hard on<em> us</em>, too!</p>
<p>(Shinji lifts his head up.</p>
<p>Asuka's choker comes into view and he turns away.)</p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p>Ugh... <em>*heaving*</em></p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Throwing up again?</p>
<p>(She grabs a ration and stuffs it into Shinji's mouth.) </p>
<p><em>(Shinji breathing heavily)</em></p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>You brat!</p>
<p>Be grateful you're getting fed like this at all!</p>
<p>You're still a pseudo-Lilin.<u>↓</u> </p>
<p>If you don't eat, you won't survive. </p>

<p>It's only been water for <em>us</em>! </p>

<p>Stupid brat!</p>
<p>You won't do anything just because you're scared of getting hurt again!</p>
<p>Since you've got free time anyway, </p>
<p>at <em>least</em> try figuring out what made me want to hit you back there!</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset="" title="Anno being weird and recording footage with his phone."/></figure><p>(Shinji with his mouth being clamped shut.)</p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p><em>*sobbing*</em></p>
<p>(He lies there, resigned to what's happening.)</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p><em>*sigh*</em></p>
<p>You're too mentally weak.</p>
<p>No matter what, everything you do backfires, </p>
<p>and it can't be undone.</p>
<p>[00:29:32, 568]</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>It's all your fault, so why bother doing anything anymore?</p>
<p>Yes, you were acting on your father's orders, </p>
<p>but since your psychological fortitude is <em>that</em> low...</p>
<p>I wish you'd never piloted Evas to begin with!</p>
<p>(Asuka withdraws her hand, and Shinji's head hits the floor.</p>
<p>Still laying there, he watches Asuka's back-turned figure until it's out of sight.)</p>
<p><strong>Shinji:</strong></p>
<p><em>*sob*</em></p>
<p>(He abruptly gets up and goes out the door.)</p>
<p><em>{Door opening and closing}</em></p>
<p>(Exterior.</p>
<p>Far beneath the rotating train, Shinji walks at a pace, fading into the distance.</p>
<p>Asuka sits on her bed.)</p>

<p>Shinji, still hanging his head, a deep blue sky behind him.</p>

<p><em>{Penguin cries}</em></p>
<p>(A hot springs penguin sends a sheet of spray into the air.</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>It swims with its flock beneath the concrete.)</p>
<p>(Interior of roofless building.)</p>
<p>[00:30:58]</p>
<p>(Even the floor is missing; only the towering walls are left.</p>
<p>Shinji is hugging his knees.</p>
<p>He hunches his back before the mountains that span from wall to wall.</p>
<p>The long shadows of pillars fall onto the lake.</p>
<p>Asuka checking in on him.</p>
<p>She leaves behind the sky, glowing with the setting sun.) </p>
<p>***</p>
<p>(Night. Kensuke's house.) </p>
<p><strong>Kensuke:</strong></p>
<p>I'm home!</p>
<p>Oh, what happened to Ikari?</p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Asuka playing a game.) </p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>He ran away. </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: 家出した refers to "running away from home"; different phrasing from "I mustn't run away".]</p>
<p><strong>Kensuke:</strong></p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>Leaving him alone is probably the best option for now. </p>
<p>Where'd he run off to?</p>
<p>[00:31:33, 582]</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>The ruins at the northern lake.</p>
<p><strong>Kensuke:</strong></p>
<p>The site of the old Nerv facility...</p>
<p>I guess it's fate.</p>
<p>What about the rations?</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>I force-fed him. </p>
<p>He'll survive, for now.</p>
<p><strong>Kensuke:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Shikinami.</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Meh. </p>
<p>It's not like I did it for him.</p>
<p>There's just no way I'll let him enjoy a self-serving death. </p>
<p>***</p>

<p>(Bathhouse converted from a train.</p>
<p>A plugsuit, work clothes, etc., are in a basket in the dressing room.) </p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>My name?</p>
<p><strong>Woman C (?):　</strong></p>
<p>Right, you can't keep calling yourself "Look-alike" forever, now can you?</p>
<p>According to the doctor, though, you can't remember your own name.</p>
<p><strong>Woman B (?):</strong></p>
<p>So then how about giving yourself a new one?</p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>I'm allowed to name myself?</p>

<p>A book? </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Insert:</p>
<p>In front of Ayanami Rei's room, Shinji topples a pile of books.)</p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>The one Ikari-kun mentioned?</p>
<p>(Other-Rei shakes the water off her umbrella.</p>
<p>The potato she was holding tumbles down the aisle.</p>
<p>There's a girl sitting in a chair. She picks up the potato and rushes over.)</p>
<p><strong>Girl:</strong></p>
<p>I picked it up, so I'm giving it back to you. </p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

<p><strong>Girl:</strong></p>
<p>Do you read?</p>
<p>(She holds out a picture book.</p>
<p>There's a little kid and a porcupine.) </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: "Porcupine" is ヤマアラシ (<em>yama'arashi</em>). In Japanese, the Hedgehog's Dilemma is called ヤマアラシのジレンマ (y<em>ama'arashi no Jiremma</em>), literally "Porcupine's Dilemma". They do have a separate word for hedgehogs -- ハリネズミ (<em>harinezumi</em>), which is what Sonic is -- so I don't know why<em> that </em>wasn't used in the first place.]</p>

<p>[00:33:30, 606]</p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>It's me.</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p><em>*sigh*</em></p>
<p>The one from the original batch. <u>↓</u> </p>
<p>I'll unlock it now.</p>
<p>(Other-Rei's rain gear is left at the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>I heard that Ikari-kun is here.</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>He's not. </p>
<p>Right now he's a runaway. </p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>I see. Then I'll try to find him. </p><figure><img src="images/file.png" srcset=""/></figure><p>(Asuka playing a game.) </p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Lemme fill you in on something.</p>
<p>We Eva pilots, just like the Evas,</p>
<p>were constrained at the planning stage to not surpass human limitations. </p>
<p>Same with us having inefficient emotions.</p>
<p>We're only <em>designed</em> to match human cognitive behavior.</p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: The word for framework or limitations here is literally something like a picture frame. The metaphorical emphasis is on the confining borders.]</p>
<p>[00:34:00, 617]</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>All of you, the Ayanami Series, are programmed with an affinity for the Third Boy.</p>
<p>What you're feeling now was planned by Nerv from the start. </p>
<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: "Programmed" is literally "adjusted" or "tuned", like a machine.]</p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>I see. But it's fine.</p>
<p>I feel good about it.</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Suit yourself then.</p>
<p>The object of your affections is at Nerv's Second Branch, the ruins of Building N109.</p>
<p><strong>Other-Rei:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>If you're going there, bring those rations with you.</p>
<p>He won't last much longer. </p>
<p>[00:34:29, 626]</p>
<p><strong>Rei:</strong></p>
<p>You aren't going to stay in the village and work?</p>
<p><strong>Asuka:</strong></p>
<p>Are you stupid?</p>
<p>This isn't somewhere I live.</p>
<p>It's somewhere I <em>protect</em>. </p>

<p>If the pillars stop working, it's game over.</p>
<p>(Leaving the group of giants behind, the car passes through the forest.)</p>

<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: Had trouble making sense of the "naive" line. Original is 「生きるためには甘っちょろいこと言うてられんかったんや」. I think he's literally saying something like, "In order to survive, I couldn't keep saying naive things", but that doesn't make a whole lot of sense...]</p>
<p><strong>Toji:</strong></p>
<p>What I do now, it's nothing as admirable as being a doctor.</p>

<p>But some lives can't be saved. </p>
<p>I still believe it's a doctor's duty to shoulder the grief and rage when that happens. </p>

</strong>ONWARD TO PART 2-A?　<a href="https://www.arqacrypha.net/post/eva-3-0-1-0-cc-ad-translation-pt-2-a" target="_self"><u>⇒ </u></a> </p><hr/><h3>Extended Notes</h3>
<p>[00:28:57, 554] <strong>"You're still a pseudo-Lilin."</strong> "Pseudo-Lilin" is リリンもどき (<em>Lilin-modoki</em>). The suffix "<em>-modoki</em>" means "being made in, or something made in, imitation; fake, sham, etc." (<a href="https://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%82%82%E3%81%A9%E3%81%8D-1211568" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>See entries at Kotobank here</u></a>.) So, "X-like", "mock X", "pseudo-X", and so forth. I've gone for "pseudo-" since it helps bring out this particular continuation of NTE's "false vs. true" thematic dichotomy. (Incidentally, "<em>-modoki</em>" can be written in kanji as 擬き. The "pseudo-" used in NTE in <em>Ha</em> and <em>Q</em> is 擬似, <em>giji</em>; note the kanji in common. Nipponica's entry at Kotobank highlights this.) </p>
<p>There is a "rule of 3" going on with<em> -modoki</em> in <em>Shin</em>. It was used during Avant 1 upon the arrival of 4444C, which Mari referred to as 使徒もどき ("<em>shito-modoki</em>"), or a "pseudo-Angel". The suffix will appear again in "part 2" during Eva-02 and Eva-08's drop, providing エヴァもどき ("<em>Eva-modoki</em>"), or "pseudo-Evas", that time around. <em>Shito-modoki, Lilin-modoki, Eva-modoki</em>? Curious indeed...</p>
<p>[00:33:32, 607] <strong>"The one from the original batch"</strong> is 初期ロット <em>(shoki rotto</em>), literally "initial lot".  Back at the end of Q, Asuka took one quick look at Rei 6 and said, 「さっきのパイロットね。綾波タイプの初期ロットか」("The pilot from earlier, I see. So you're [from the] initial lot of Ayanami Types." A "lot" in this context is a manufacturing term; you can find more information e.g. at the <a href="https://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%83%E3%83%88-153097" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>third entry here</u></a> (which even addresses<em> shoki rotto</em> specifically) and, in English, <a href="https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/18981/word-meaning-batch-vs-lot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">,<u>here</u></a>. </p>
<p>In <em>Shin</em>, Asuka has reappropriated 初期ロット as her nickname for Rei 6, as this isn't the only time she uses it. Interestingly, this <em>is</em> the only time her nickname for another pilot doesn't reference nepotism in some way.</p>
<p>And in case you're wondering, Japanese is the kind of language that lets you do things like refer to a single clone as "initial lot". Obviously this doesn't work in English, though, so you have to do something like add "one of/from" or come up with another workaround. (I use "<strong>early </strong>[Ayanami]<strong> type</strong>" the second time Asuka calls Rei 6 "<em>shoki rotto</em>".)</p>
<p>[00:41:59, 692] <strong>"They're called 'Haikai'."</strong> "Haikai" is written all in katakana (ハイカイ), which means this is probably another case of Anno squeezing as many meanings out of something as humanly possible. Written 俳徊, <em>haikai</em> can mean "wandering" or "roaming", which isn't inappropriate, but it's far from the only possibility. Consider first the multiple potential ways to split up "Haikai"...</p>
<p>HAI-KAI</p>
<p>HAI-KA-I</p>
<p>HA-I-KAI</p>
<p>HA-I-KA-I</p>
<p>...and then account for the multiple thematically relevant kanji attached to each of those (<em>hai, kai, ha, ka, i</em>). It's crazy. So... I'm not even going to attempt to translate this term. Very curious what Kanemitsu ends up using for it.</p>
<p>[00:52:11, 844] <strong>"I wanted to keep being with the people I care about."</strong> Oh boy, this fucking line. Original is 「好きな人とずっと一緒にいたかった」 (<em>"Suki na hito to zutto issho ni itakatta"</em>). We're dealing with the notorious "<em>suki</em>" here, which can describe feelings anywhere from general fondness or affinity to "liking" someone in the "I'm too bashful (slash Japanese) to call it 'love'" kind of way); and, specifically, "<em>suki na hito</em>", which could refer to one person or multiple ("person/people I like"). The line as a whole could be given a "weak" rendition, a "strong" rendition, or something in between. The weak rendition is included by default. A stronger, shipper-friendly variant might be "I wanted to be with the one I like forever". </p>
<p>There's an argument to be made for either interpretation. For the "strong" version, you might point to Asuka telling Rei that she's programmed with an affinity to Shinji, or to Rei telling Shinji "Because we like you". For the "weak" version, you might consider that Rei saying "I wanted to keep being with the people I care about" follows directly on her saying that she wishes she could hold Tsubame again, and calls back to the earlier scene where Hikari commends how good Rei is with Tsubame and tells her, "I wish you could stay with us forever". </p>
<p>The best part of all this that the two versions are not mutually exclusive. (Which makes sense; Anno is big on that sort of ambiguity.) Now, that said, since I had to pick only <em>one</em> to be the default translation, I went with the non-shippy version, on account of it being more inclusive. "People I care about" includes Shinji, whereas "the person I like" does<em> not</em> include everyone in the village with whom Rei has formed a relationship. </p><hr/><p><u>Return to Top</u> </p>
